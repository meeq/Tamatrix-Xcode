# Tamatrix for iOS/watchOS/tvOS

[![Tamagotchi Hive by xkcd (\#1546)](./Tamagotchi-Hive-xkcd.png)](https://xkcd.com/1546/)

The singularity happened, but not to us. Standing on the shoulders of the awesome [Tamatrix project by Jeroen Domburg (Sprite_tm)](http://spritesmods.com/?art=tamasingularity), this project is an extension of the original work to support viewing hives and running Tamagotchi emulators on iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

## Tama-Hive

Tama-Hive connects to a Tamatrix web server and provides a viewer of all of the actively-connected Tamagotchi in the hive. You can change the server URL in the Settings app.

## Tama-Emu

Tama-Emu runs an instance of the Tamatrix emulator on your device, allowing you to watch and interact with the virtual pet. You can enable the "benevolent AI" in the Settings app to take over the care and feeding of your Tamagotchi.
